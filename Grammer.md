Grammer simple part
1. No verb tenses. Just say 'In the future; 3 day later；before' in the sentence.
2. No ‘s’ or ‘es’ be added to verb. I, you, he, she, it all can use do instead of does.
3. No 'to do' and 'doing'. All is 'to do'. If you want to present the doing meaning, just add your meaning!
4. No too many linking verbs. Only be. I be, you be, he be, she be, we be.
5. To be added....
